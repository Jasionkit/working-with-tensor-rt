Code accompanying my blog posts "working with tensor rt" and "drawing with cuda"

This code was created as I was learning how to load models of any type, bind to their Input/Output layers
and then draw the results using the GPU.

This code was made to be run as a ROS node in C++.

This code was made by converting 2 posenet models I found on Nvidia's TRT Pose Repo for python here: https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/trt_pose

You can adapt this code for your purposes.

If you do something cool, please let me know.
